# PokeMMO: 1-Hour 30-Gym Rerun
This route was designed by [**JinxedBoon**](https://youtu.be/fL9BZ5de6EA?si=wzOcVAtcpTSCy45O) and modified by [**Sentor_G**](https://www.twitch.tv/sentor_g).<br>
A huge thanks to [**Bills**](https://forums.pokemmo.com/index.php?%2Ftopic%2F161519-custom-string%F0%9F%87%BA%F0%9F%87%B8%F0%9F%87%AA%F0%9F%87%B8%F0%9F%87%AE%F0%9F%87%B9%F0%9F%87%AB%F0%9F%87%B7%F0%9F%87%A7%F0%9F%87%B7fastergyms-berrys-e4-region-speed-runlast-update-18-02-2024%2F) for the updated strings to make the dialogue run a lot faster.<br><br>
â€¢ **Please note:** this run heavily relies on good RNG and your team being able to hit/be hit sufficiently. There is a breakdown of the team composition in JinxedBoon's video, which I have attached as a reference in the credit given above. 29 Gyms is the average amount achievable in 1 hour. The 30th Gym is only really accessible with financial boosts if no player or AI issues occur.<br><br>â€¢ **If Cottonee remains on the field after turn 1, always press Memento on turn 2 (DO NOT switch).**<br><br>â€¢ It is advised to use riches charm items before battling Wattson because if T&L lead Wobbufet, multiple Gyms will be discounted from the financial bonus.<br><br>â€¢ Gym Leaders with *(Full HP)* in front of the turn order means the main attacking PokÃ©mon require being topped up with healing potions (if necessary) before starting the battle.
### Route Information:<br>
â€¢ **Hoenn:**<br>
Set Slateport as Teleport heal **(TPH)** location. This is achieved by simply stepping inside the PokÃ©mon Center.<br>TPH instructs the player to use Teleport to heal.
